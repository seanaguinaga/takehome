Task:

Build a note taking app on web

---

Requirements:

- Functionality
   - Ability to see your notes
   - Ability to create a note
   - Ability to edit a note
   - Ability to delete a note

- Languages/technologies
   - Use React for frontend
   - Use GraphQL as the API layer

- Server
   - All notes should be stored in a remote database, not locally (see tips)

- Design
   - This is completely up to you how it will look, but no need to go crazy with it

---

Deliverables:

- Github link to project

---

Tips:

- For the GraphQL API some good options are Prisma or Hasura Graphql (these are also free and have great tutorials for setting up simple apps). These also will help you set up the API + the actual database
- Reference the Notes app on Mac for design
- Any GitHub repos, libraries, and frameworks are welcome but please don’t copy any note taking interface outright. I.e. using React Material UI is great, but don’t take something like this https://github.com/jwmunn/notes-react-app
- Feel free to ask any questions along the way
